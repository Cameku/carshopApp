**** HTML & CSS ****
- Used bootstrap, normalize.css, grid.css and google fonts
- Clicking on the car images will take you to car-details below.
- The 'Search for car section, populates fields using vehicle API created. (See attached image). 


**** Server ****
- Created a package.json file.
- Installed JSON-Server for a fake REST API.
- Installed Node.js, created vehicle database (see attached image).
- http://localhost:3000/vehicles.
- http://localhost:3000/vehicles?makeName=MERCEDES-BENZ (search for MERCEDES-BENZ)


**** JavaScript & JQuery ****
- I used the Module Pattern for my javaScript(see script.js)

- Reasons for using this pattern:
    - For a clean and organised code.
    - To encapsulate some data into privacy and expose other publicly.
    - For a robust application architecture.
    - For separation of concerns.
    
- Some of the things considered during coding
    - No memory leaks
    - DRY code
    - Use of IIFE
